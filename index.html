They create an image of pure, uninhibited pleasure, making them seem like an escape from the mundane world." },
            { title: "The Rake", description: "Insatiably desires and pursues women, moving from one to the next. Their appeal lies in their intense, undivided attention and reputation.", details: "The Rake does not hesitate to express his desire. His language is unapologetically sexual and his focus on the victim is intense, making them feel like the most desired person in the world. His reputation as a great lover precedes him, creating a powerful allure." },
            { title: "The Ideal Lover", description: "Reflects the victim's fantasy. They study their target and mirror their deepest desires, appearing as the perfect, dreamed-of partner.", details: "Ideal Lovers are masters of observation. They listen more than they talk, uncovering what's missing in their victim's life. They then construct a persona that fills that void, creating a powerful and addictive illusion of perfection." },

They are fluid and refuse to be categorized.", details: "Dandies attract through their psychological independence and unique style. They are not concerned with pleasing others and this self-sufficiency is magnetic. Their ambiguity makes them an object of fascination." },
            { title: "The Natural", description: "Embodies the longed-for qualities of childhood—spontaneity, sincerity, and unpretentiousness. They are a breath of fresh air.", details: "Naturals bring a sense of playfulness and ease. They seem open and unguarded, which disarms their victims. In a world full of cynicism, their apparent innocence is a powerful seductive tool." },
            { title: "The Coquette", description: "Masters of the art of delayed gratification. They lure with the promise of reward, then withdraw, keeping the victim in a state of suspense.", details: "Coquettes are self-sufficient. They seem to not need their victim, which is maddening and intriguing. They alternate between warmth and coldness, hope and frustration, creating a powerful emotional rollercoaster that gets their victims addicted." },
            { title: "The Charmer", description: "Makes the victim the center of attention. They are masters of creating comfort, pleasure, and a feeling of being understood.", details: "Charmers operate by focusing completely on their target. They deflect attention from themselves and make the other person feel fascinating. This validation is highly seductive, lowering defenses and creating deep attachment." },
            { title: "The Charismatic", description: "Possesses an inner confidence, sexual energy, and sense of purpose that radiates outward, making them seem extraordinary.", details: "Charisma is a presence that excites. Charismatics have an intense gaze, powerful rhetoric, and an air of mystery. People are drawn to their energy and believe in their cause or vision, often without knowing why." },
            { title: "The Star", description: "Lives in a world of their own, distinct and distant. Their distance and dreamlike quality make others want to get closer.", details: "Stars create a unique and ethereal persona. They combine a dazzling presence with a cool detachment.
